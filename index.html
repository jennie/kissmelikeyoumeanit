<!-- He is my love, he's always been it -->
<body>

<pre>He says, "Come here baby and
  Kiss me like you mean it"
  He calls me baby
  Says, "Kiss me like you mean it"


  He is my light and my salvation
  He's always right, he's always patient
  I pinch myself
  It's like I'm dreaming it</pre>
</body>
